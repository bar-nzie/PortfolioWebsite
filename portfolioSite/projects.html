                <p>Collaborated in a small team to design and develop an educational game for the ThinkTank! Museum in Birmingham over a 12-week period. This project involved regular communication with stakeholders to gather and manage requirements, ensuring alignment with the museum's educational goals. Gained valuable insight into how audience demographics influence design decisions. The experience strengthened my communication, time management, and adaptability—particularly in responding to project delays and supporting team members to meet deadlines. Allowed for experience in development lifecycles. As management over GitHub it allowed for advanced experience with it. <a href="https://github.com/bar-nzie/ThinkTank-Spitfire-Games" style="color:white">Spitfire Game</a></p>

                <p>Created a game engine from the ground up. Gained an understanding on how to optimise how a game enigine works. Gained experience in C++. Performed system diagnostics to determine what put most stress on the computer resources such as the CPU and GPU. Game engine also works on Linux demonstrating understanding of working woth alternative OS.<a href="Assets/GameEngineProject.zip" style="color:white">Game Engine</a></p>

                <p>Created a Ray Tracer and Rasteriser from the ground up. Worked with a path tracer to create a scene from a reference screenshot. Created a rasteriser within C++ to recreate the scene from scratch creating systems that interpret data from an obj file. Then created a ray tracer to gain an understanding on how light interacts with objects within a level and how each object interacts with one another.<a href="Assets/coursework.zip" style="color:white">Rasteriser and Ray Tracer</a></p>
